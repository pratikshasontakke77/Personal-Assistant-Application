# Personal-Assistant-Application
This aplication is developed purely in C++, which converts text to speech. It fulfills the commands such as Opening Browser, Opening a Website, Playing Songs etc.
To use this Personal Assistant, we need to download 'espeak' - Speech Synthesizer( Link for download - http://espeak.sourceforge.net/)
Save the espeak .exe file into the same folder where you're writing demo.cpp
Using any C++ IDE (I've used Code::Blocks) , run the demo.cpp
